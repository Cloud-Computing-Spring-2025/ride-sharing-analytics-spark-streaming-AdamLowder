Spark structured streaming example

In this assignment we are working with real time processing in spark to process streaming data, perfrom aggregations, and analyze rends over time.
1. part 1: for part one we are just ingesting the data being stremed from data_generator.py into a spark dataframe with the correctt column formats.
1. part 2: task 2 is supposed to aggregate data in real time and group total fare amount and distance by driver id before returning to a csv file 
1. part 3: task 3 converts the ttimestamp column to a timestamp type before using the window aggregation. I didntt really get far into this part due to my issues on part 2.

1. Issues: on part 2 I tried running he file butt it wouldn't output to a csv properly. I tried plugging my existing code and updating it with chatgpt but it still doesnt seem to want to pront to a file correctly. The one time i did work it onl showed the headers for te columns.
